## Privacy Policy

**1. Introduction**
FPL Bro ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension collects, uses, and discloses your information. By installing and using the FPL Bro extension, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

**2. Information We Collect**
To provide AI-assisted insights for your Fantasy Premier League draft, FPL Bro collects the following specific data:

* **Authentication Data:** We capture specific session cookies (e.g., `pl_profile`) and authentication tokens from the `draft.premierleague.com` domain when you browse the site.
* **Game Data:** We access your FPL Draft squad information, league details, and player statistics.
* **Technical Data:** We may collect standard server logs (IP address, browser type) when your extension communicates with our servers.

**3. How We Use Your Information**
We use the collected information for the following purposes:

* **Server-Side Synchronization:** Your authentication tokens are securely transmitted to our backend servers. This allows our system to fetch the latest data regarding your squad and league status in the background, without requiring the browser to remain open.
* **AI Analysis:** Your squad data is processed to generate personalized transfer recommendations, lineup advice, and strategy optimization via our AI algorithms.
* **Service Maintenance:** To troubleshoot issues and ensure the extension functions correctly.

**4. Data Transfer and Storage**
**Important:** Your authentication data does not stay on your device. It is transmitted over a secure (HTTPS) connection to our private servers. We store this data to maintain a continuous connection with the Fantasy Premier League API on your behalf. We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your tokens and data from unauthorized access.

**5. Third-Party Services**
We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
* **Fantasy Premier League:** We interact with the official API to fetch your game data.
* **AI Providers:** Non-identifiable game data (squads/stats) may be processed by third-party LLM (Large Language Model) providers to generate strategic text.
* **Hosting:** We use cloud hosting providers to run our background workers and database.

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal identification information or authentication tokens to others.

**6. User Rights and Data Deletion**
You have the right to request the deletion of your data. If you uninstall the extension, you must also contact us to remove your data from our backend servers. Please contact us at the email below to request the permanent deletion of your tokens and user profile.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
